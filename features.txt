=== CamillaFIR Features List (v2.6.2 Stable) ===

--- CORE DSP & FILTER GENERATION ---

Advanced FIR Engine: Generates high-precision 32-bit float FIR filters for room and speaker correction.

Quad-Phase Strategy:

Linear Phase: Full timing and frequency correction for audiophile performance.

Asymmetric Linear Phase: Low-latency linear phase mode using a 100ms/500ms windowing strategy to minimize pre-ringing.

Minimum Phase: Zero-latency correction, ideal for gaming and live TV.

Mixed Phase: Hybrid approach using Linear Phase for bass (<300Hz) and Minimum Phase for treble.

Temporal Decay Control (TDC): Active resonance damping that identifies ringing frequencies and reduces their decay time (ms) in the time domain.

Adaptive FDW (A-FDW): Intelligent windowing that dynamically adjusts cycle counts based on acoustic confidence masking to prevent artifacts in chaotic regions.

Transparent FIR Split: Uses a complementary linear-phase crossover for seamless sub-band merging in Mixed Phase mode.

Dynamic Kaiser Windowing: Automatically calculates optimal beta parameters to ensure perfect impulse response truncation and minimal ripples.
=== CamillaFIR Features List (v2.5.7) ===

--- CORE DSP & FILTER GENERATION ---
* Advanced FIR Engine: Generates high-precision 32-bit float FIR filters for room and speaker correction.
* Triple Phase Strategy:
    - Linear Phase: Full timing and frequency correction for audiophile performance.
    - Minimum Phase: Zero-latency correction, ideal for gaming and live TV.
    - Mixed Phase: Hybrid approach using Linear Phase for bass (<300Hz) and Minimum Phase for treble.
* Transparent FIR Split: Uses a complementary linear-phase crossover for seamless sub-band merging in Mixed Phase mode.
* Time-of-Flight (TOF) Detection: Automatically calculates and removes propagation delay via linear regression (1kHz-10kHz) to isolate true excess phase.
* Frequency-Dependent Regularization: Smart algorithm that varies correction strength by frequency to avoid artifacts when filling room nulls.
* Excess Phase Safety Masks: Hard-coded protection that tapers phase correction at extreme frequencies (<15Hz and >19kHz) to ensure stability.

--- MAGNITUDE & TARGETING ---
* Level Matching Engine:
    - Automatic and Manual modes.
    - Configurable frequency window (e.g., 500Hz - 2000Hz) for sensitivity calculation.
    - Selectable algorithms: 'Median' (robust against narrow spikes) or 'Average'.
* Integrated Target Curves: Includes Harman (+6dB/+8dB), Dr. Toole, B&K 1974, Flat, and Cinema X-Curve.
* Custom Target Support: Upload personal target curve files in .txt format.
* Psychoacoustic Smoothing: Optional smoothing logic that simulates human hearing integration.

--- SYSTEM INTEGRATION ---
* CamillaDSP Support: Automatically generates 'camilladsp.yml' configuration snippets.
* Universal Compatibility: Exports filters as standard .wav or raw .txt coefficients for Hardware DSPs.
* Hardware Optimization: Specialized logic for short filters (512-1024 taps) suitable for ADAU1701/SigmaDSP.
* Multi-Rate Export: One-click generation for all common sample rates (44.1k to 192k).

--- UTILITIES & PROTECTION ---
* Crossover Linearization: Built-in tool to correct the phase shift of existing analog or digital crossovers (1st to 8th order).
* Subsonic HPF: Integrated high-pass filter with selectable slopes (6dB to 48dB/oct) to protect woofers.
* Excursion Protection: Prevents bass boost below a user-defined frequency (e.g., port tuning).
* Automatic Normalization: Safeguards against digital clipping by normalizing filter peaks to -1.0 dB.
* Stereo Link: Maintains the original volume balance between Left and Right channels during correction.
* Impulse Alignment: Automatically aligns the peaks of the L/R channels to fix hardware or placement delays.

--- VISUALIZATION ---
* High-Resolution Plots: Generates magnitude, phase, and group delay plots using Matplotlib (PNG) and interactive Plotly (HTML).
* Prediction Analysis: Shows the estimated system response after applying the generated filter.
* Calculation Reports: Provides a detailed 'Summary.txt' with all DSP statistics and settings.
